# Introduction

One of the major challenges in early drug discovery is the detection of <span class="blue-font">frequent
false-positive</span> results (Fig.1), which have seriously interfered with hit
identification, thus leading to a waste of time and resource. To avoid the attributions caused by false positive
results, <span class="blue-font">ChemFH (Chemical Frequent Hitter)</span>, an integrated online platform is developed
for the screening and prediction of potential frequent hitters, covering <span class="blue-font">colloidal aggregate,
firefly luciferase reporter enzyme inhibition, fluorescence, chemical reactivity and promiscuity</span>. Based on the
collection of <span class="black-font">a large and high-quality database</span> and the application
of <span class="black-font">Graph Neural Networks architectures</span>, ChemFH is able to accomplish reliable
detection capability of frequent hitters, thus improving the efficiency of drug R&D.
